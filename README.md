# üöÄ prs

> Only shows PRs waiting on YOU

A fast CLI that filters GitHub PRs to show only what needs your attention. No more digging through dozens of PRs to find the ones that actually need you.

## Quick Start

```bash
go install github.com/ready-to-review/prs@latest
prs
```

**Requirements:** Go 1.23+ and GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated

## Usage

```bash
# Show PRs you're involved with (filters out stale PRs)
prs

# Only PRs waiting for your review
prs --blocked

# Include old/stale PRs
prs --include-stale

# Auto-refresh view
prs --watch

# Get notified when PRs need attention
prs --notify
```

## What You'll See

### Default View (`prs`)
![Default View](media/default.png)

### Live Focus Mode (`prs --blocked --watch`)
![Watch Blocked View](media/watch_blocked.png)

## Options

- `--blocked` - Only PRs blocking on you
- `--include-stale` - Include old PRs (hidden by default)
- `--watch` - Live updates with real-time WebSocket + polling
- `--exclude-orgs` - Comma-separated list of organizations to exclude
- `--verbose` - Show detailed logging

### Color Output

Colors are automatically adjusted based on your terminal capabilities. To disable colors entirely:

```bash
NO_COLOR=1 prs
```

This respects the [NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org/) standard.

## Status Icons

- üöß Draft PR
- ‚úÖ Ready to merge
- üëç Has approval

## Why This Tool?

Stop context switching through GitHub tabs. This tool uses smart filtering to show only PRs that actually need your input - not PRs waiting on CI, other reviewers, or ones you've already reviewed.

Built fast in Go because your development tools shouldn't slow you down.
